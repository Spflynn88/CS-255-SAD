In these projects for CS-255 we used a client called DriverPass as an example. DriverPass is setting up a web app to allow student to take practice written driving tests
as well as setup appointments for behind the wheel experience.
I think I did a good job with these projects. I was able to gather the correct requirements for the client and put together 2 good documents. If there is something I 
would change it would be to review my class diagram and sequence diagram. I feel that the sequence diagram is missing something, but I'm not sure really what.

When designing a system such as DriverPass it's important to make sure that the clients needs are being met. When the product is delivered it should be able to do the tasks that the customer needs it to do.
Designing software is a long and complicated process, its necessary to keep the clients goals in mind during this time. You don't want to stray from the goal during the SDLC and
have the client end up with a product that is no good to them.
